                                    <h3>A Duck</h3>
                                    <p>Hello and welcome! My name is Marissa and I'd like to start off by telling you a fun fact about myself. If I were to be any animal, I would consider myself something like a duck. Not because I have wonderfully orange feet that make funny sounds on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIFqwSfzVrM"> hardwood floors</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B7llRD3nWcJ/">drums</a>, although I am a huge fan of the color orange, but because I like to live like a duck. Michael Caine's quote, <em> "Be like a duck. Calm on the surface, but paddling like the dickens underneath"</em> exemplifies the way I like to work, learn, and enjoy the things I do, calm and collected, but full of zest. A few other quick facts: I love Honey Nut Cheerios, excel in hammocking, am both a cat <em>and </em> a dog person, dislike wet socks, and am an avid outdoors lover.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3> A Student: Sko Buffs </h3>
									<p>I grew up in Denver, Colorado, but moved to Boulder to attend the University of Colorado Boulder. I'm currently a senior pursuing a Bachelor of Science in information science. Additionally, I have completed my minor in global business from the Leeds School of Business and am in the last course to finish my certificateÂ in TAM (technology, arts & media) from the Atlas Institute. I've loved every second of it, especially the people (and dogs) I've met along the way! Outside of classes, I am a research assistant in the <a href="https://cmci.colorado.edu/idlab/">Identity Lab</a> led by Dr. Jed Brubaker, the president and one of the founding members of the information science club, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cuboulderinfobuffs/">INFO Buffs</a>, and a <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/ambassadors"> student ambassador</a> within my college, CMCI (College of Media, Communication & Information). </p>
                                    
                                    <h3>A Dancer: 5,6,7,8...</h3>
                                    <p>I've been keeping myself sane by dancing for the past 19 years, and am currently on three teams at my school: Boulder Bole Bhangra, VeRVE Collisionz. and CU Milana. I grew up learning traditional Chinese folk dance at the <a href="http://www.christinayehchinesedancestudio.com/">Christina Yeh Dance Studio</a> and later began multiple styles of Indian dance, including Kathak and Bhangra, in 2010 with <a href="https://mudradancestudio.us/">Mudra Dance Studio</a>. Dancing has become my main creative outlet and I am always willing to learn a new style! Throughout these years, all of these teachers and peers have been a wonderful addition to my life and I hold the teachers, dancers, and choreography close to my heart. </p>  
                                    <p> I have been on <a href="https://instagram.com/cuboulderbbhangra"> Boulder Bole Bhangra</a>, CU's bhangra-hip hop team for all 4 years of college and am one of the current captains. This team is in it's 6th year and has only gotten better!</p> 
                                    <p> I also joined<a href="https://www.instagram.com/vervecollisionz/">VeRVE</a>, the school's street dance team my freshman year and have been on it ever since! We host the largest hip-hop competition in the state of Colorado every year! Alongside the dancing, I am the human resources head and help to mediate any conflict between team members and also team members to leadership. </p>
                                    <p> This past year, I helped begin <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cubouldermilana/"> CU Milana</a>, the Bollywood fusion dance team. This team is not only the first of its kind at CU Boulder, but also the first in the state of Colorado <em> and </em>the first within the mountain range!! This team plans to compete within the Desi Dance Network(DDN) and national competitions. I'm very proud of the work this team has accomplished in its first year!</p>
                                    <p> This spring, I was invited to be a liaison for one of the largest Bollywood dance shows in the nation, <a href="https://www.legends.desidancenetwork.org/"> LEGENDS</a>! While the pandemic canceled the show, the network of people I met through my time with the other liaisons was unbelievably fun and I am stoked for the next show! </p>
                                    
                                    <h3>A 'Yak'-er: Expeditions galore!</h3>
                                    <p>Along with academics and dance, I love sea kayaking in the summer and skiing in the winter! Living in Colorado means there isn't really an off-season, so in the mean time, I find myself outdoors via running, hiking, biking,xc skiing, snowshoeing, playing tennis, and of course, hammocking. During the summers, I've been attending Camp Orkila, a YMCA camp, where I ignited a new love for the water and sea kayaking! After being a participant for many years, I became a logistics assistant and finally a sea kayak instructor in 2018. I have been spoiled with unbelievably beautiful sunrises and sunsets am even more rewarded by the communities built with the other instructors and participants. As an avid outdoors lover, I became interested in the intersection between humans, technology, and the outdoors and hope to continue learning more about this in the future. </p>
									
                                    <h3>TLDR:</h3>
                                    <p>I am beyond grateful for the life I live. I have had numerous opportunities to travel and explore new hobbies and I appreciate everything each adventure has taught me. I love learning, dancing, have a passion for the outdoors. If you want to understand my humor, watch any episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Or binge it. I won't judge! Oh, and I still don't like wet socks.</p>
