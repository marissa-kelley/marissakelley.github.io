Portfolio

Welcome to my personal profile! My goal of creating this is to have a more professional profile that I can use for sharing the work I do! 

### Getting Started
Here is a [Medium post](https://medium.com/tunapanda-institute/8-steps-to-publish-your-portfolio-on-github-9d6e6e3d2e84) I read to get started! Here is a secondary [source](https://github.com/maxharlow/tutorials/tree/master/build-a-website-with-html-and-git) I found to be really useful in creating this!

### More About Me:
Here is my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marissa-kelley/) profile.
